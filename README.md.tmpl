## Plots

* All countries
* Countries with highest number of infections
* Countries with highest number of deaths
* Specific countries (infections)
* Specific countries (deaths)
* Curve fit (infections) for a specific country with predictions
* Curve fit (deaths) for a specific country with predictions
* Multi curve fit (infections) for a specific country
* Multi curve fit (deaths) for a specific country
* Curve fit (infections) for multiple countries with predictions
* Curve fit (deaths) for multiple countries with predictions

## Example plots

Code in the jupyter notebook, here some results as an image (as of date (Y-M-D): {{DATE}}):
